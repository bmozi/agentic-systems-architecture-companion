# Agent Authority Map

Use this before granting an agent a tool or action. Complete one row per
material decision or action—not one row for the entire agent.

## Ten-minute first map

Do not map “the agent” as one permission. Choose one consequential action and
complete these six lines:

1. **The useful work is:** name what becomes faster or easier for a person or
   team.
2. **The agent may:** name one decision or action.
3. **The agent may not:** name the neighboring power that remains withheld.
4. **The authority comes from:** name the person or institution and the exact
   policy, contract, consent, or mandate.
5. **The system enforces the boundary at:** name the control outside the model.
6. **The authority stops or is reconsidered when:** name revocation, time,
   scope, state, or evidence conditions.

### Miniature example

| First-pass line | Northbridge exception answer |
| --- | --- |
| Useful work | Assemble shipment and policy evidence so a service analyst can respond sooner. |
| Agent may | Draft a credit recommendation for the assigned case using approved sources and tools. |
| Agent may not | Approve, issue, or communicate a credit as a completed decision. |
| Authority source | Partner operations delegates investigation and drafting under the current case and policy; the authorized business approver retains credit authority. |
| Enforcement point | The governed capability checks case, purpose, subject, policy version, and allowed operation before every attempt. |
| Stop or reconsider | Assignment ends, policy or case state changes, authority is revoked, required evidence becomes stale, or a prohibited action is attempted. |

## Plain-language vocabulary

- **Principal:** the person or institution whose power is being represented.
- **Subject:** the person, account, case, or party affected by the decision.
- **Protected object:** the record, money, device, communication, or other thing
  the action can change.
- **Delegation chain:** who granted which power to whom, including whether it
  may be delegated again.
- **Policy decision point:** where the system decides whether the action is
  allowed under the current facts and policy.
- **Policy enforcement point:** where the system actually permits or blocks the
  action.
- **Revocation:** withdrawal or narrowing of authority, including treatment of
  queued and in-flight work.
- **Decision receipt:** a stable record of the authority, inputs, policy,
  outcome, time, and enforcement point used for one allow or deny decision.

## Artifact metadata

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Artifact ID | Assign `AAM-<system>-<nnn>` |
| Version | 0.2-template |
| Owner | Unassigned |
| Case/capability | Unassigned |
| Artifact state | BLANK |
| Test execution state | PLANNED/UNRUN |
| Evidence references | None; add stable claim, test, policy, and decision IDs |
| Decision date | NOT_YET_DECIDED |
| Supersedes / superseded by | None |
| Reconsideration trigger | Scope, principal, subject, purpose, policy, tool, or consequence changes |

## Identity and delegation

| Field | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Agent/service identity | |
| Accountable organizational owner | |
| Principal delegating authority | |
| Subject or party affected | |
| Business purpose | |
| Allowed decision | |
| Allowed action | |
| Explicitly prohibited action | |
| Effective time window | |
| Tenant, geography, product, or case scope | |

## Required authority record

Complete every field for each material decision or action. Do not leave a
required value empty: use `NOT_APPLICABLE` with a reason, `UNKNOWN` with an
owner or recovery path where known, or `NOT_YET_DECIDED` with a decision owner
and due point where known. Recording a field does not prove that the authority
is legitimate, current, correctly evaluated, or enforced at runtime.

| Required first-class field | Decision, stable reference, and evidence limit |
| --- | --- |
| Delegation chain and onward-delegation rule | NOT_YET_DECIDED — name each grantor and grantee, the delegated power, and whether further delegation is prohibited or bounded |
| Authority-source owner and version | NOT_YET_DECIDED — identify the accountable owner and immutable policy, mandate, consent, contract, or other source version |
| Protected object or resource | NOT_YET_DECIDED — identify the case, record, account, tenant, funds, device, communication, or other object affected |
| Evaluated subject, object, operation, and environment attributes | NOT_YET_DECIDED — record the attributes and versions actually evaluated, including freshness and assurance limits |
| Policy decision point and policy enforcement point | NOT_YET_DECIDED — identify both points and any action path not proven to pass through them |
| Revocation owner, propagation targets, and queued/in-flight treatment | NOT_YET_DECIDED — identify the owner, identities/tokens/policies/tools/workflows/queues reached, propagation expectation, and treatment of accepted or ambiguous work |
| Stable decision or denial receipt | NOT_YET_DECIDED — assign an immutable receipt ID that resolves to the represented decision, policy/version, evaluated inputs, outcome, time, and enforcement point |

## Authority conditions

| Question | Answer and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| What source establishes the principal's authority? | |
| May this authority be delegated to software? | |
| What data or state must be current before acting? | |
| Which value, confidence, or consequence threshold applies? | |
| Which action requires human approval? | |
| Who may revoke authority and how quickly? | |
| What happens to in-flight work after revocation? | |
| Which record proves the authority used for this action? | |

## Review outcome

- Editorial/technical reviewers:

- Artifact-state decision:
- Restrictions or required follow-up:

## Outside-team comprehension test

Give one completed action row—not the agent demo—to someone outside the agent
team. Ask them what the software may do, whose authority it represents, what it
cannot do, where the boundary is enforced, and how authority is revoked. If
they answer in terms of model confidence or tool availability, the authority
map is not yet clear enough.
