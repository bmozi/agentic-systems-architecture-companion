# Memory and Provenance Record

Use this record for any stored or retrieved information that may influence an
agent's consequential decision.

## Artifact metadata

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Artifact ID | Assign `MPR-<system>-<nnn>` |
| Version | 0.2-template |
| Owner | Unassigned |
| Case/capability | Unassigned |
| Artifact state | BLANK |
| Test execution state | PLANNED/UNRUN |
| Evidence references | None; add stable source, lineage, test, use, and correction IDs |
| Decision date | NOT_YET_DECIDED |
| Supersedes / superseded by | None |
| Reconsideration trigger | Source, derivation, purpose, policy, retention, or correction behavior changes |

## Meaning and fitness

- Memory/context item or class:
- Intended decision use:
- Meaning in plain language:
- Authoritative source, if any:
- Why this representation is fit for this use:
- Uses for which it is not fit:

## Provenance and lifecycle

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source identity and version | |
| Retrieval or derivation method | |
| Transformation/model version | |
| Created/observed time | |
| Effective time | |
| Expiration/revalidation time | |
| Tenant/subject/purpose constraints | |
| Classification and retention | |
| Derived descendants | |

## Required influence record

Complete every field for each retained item or explicitly scoped item class.
Do not leave a required value empty: use `NOT_APPLICABLE` with a reason,
`UNKNOWN` with an owner or recovery path where known, or `NOT_YET_DECIDED` with
a decision owner and due point where known. A completed record describes an
instrumented path; it does not prove source truth, complete causality,
correction completeness, or safe model use.

| Required first-class field | Value, stable reference, and evidence limit |
| --- | --- |
| Memory type or layer: transient context, retrieved, derived, parametric, or authoritative operational state | NOT_YET_DECIDED — choose one layer and explain any local refinement |
| Context ordering, truncation, and trust classification | NOT_YET_DECIDED — record position/order, truncation or exclusion behavior, and trusted/untrusted/advisory/authoritative classification |
| Retrieval query, index version, and relevance-score meaning | NOT_YET_DECIDED — record the exact or immutable query reference, index/snapshot version, and what the score does and does not mean; use NOT_APPLICABLE when no retrieval occurs |
| Known omissions and undiscovered-descendant disclaimer | NOT_YET_DECIDED — list known missing sources or descendants and state that undiscovered copies or effects may remain |
| Parametric model, provider, version, and disclosed knowledge-cutoff metadata | NOT_YET_DECIDED — record available metadata without treating it as item-level lineage or currentness proof; use UNKNOWN when the provider does not disclose a value |
| Stable use-event and consequential-decision receipt linking each retained item to actual use | NOT_YET_DECIDED — link each retained item actually used to an immutable use-event receipt and, when consequential, the resulting decision receipt; do not infer use from retrieval alone |

## Correction behavior

- How a source correction is detected:
- How derived memory is invalidated or superseded:
- How in-flight decisions are rechecked:
- Whether prior actions require correction:
- Owner and evidence of completion:

## Trust decision

- Allowed influence: advisory / planning / decision / action precondition
- Required corroboration:
- Failure behavior when unavailable or stale:
- Evidence recorded at use time:
- Remaining uncertainty:

## Review record

- Editorial/technical reviewers:
- Review date:
- Artifact-state decision:
- Restrictions or required follow-up:
